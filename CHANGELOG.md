# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.26.2] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **SRE Action Safety**: `k8s_blast_radius` tool — pre-flight simulator for destructive operations (drain, cordon, delete, scale). Returns a `safe`/`risky`/`unsafe` verdict with structured reasons and details, **without executing the action**.
- **Multi-Action Analysis**: drain (last-replica detection, stateful flags, orphan pod warnings); cordon (capacity assessment); delete (PDB coverage, dependent Services, singleton risk, LoadBalancer external-IP impact); scale (PDB minAvailable violations, scale-to-zero unsafe flagging, scale-up capacity notes).
- **Security**: `k8s_blast_radius` registered in `READ_ONLY_TOOLS` — read-only by design (analyzes only, never executes).
- **Testing**: 36-test unit suite covering verdict escalation, owner-reference walking, label-selector matching, and the four action-specific decision paths.
- **Doc Sync**: Updated README tool count from stale 264 to 267 (catches drift since 0.24.0 plus this release).


## [0.26.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Multi-Platform Proliferation**: Standardized and optimized documentation for **Gemini CLI**, **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Antigravity**, **VS Code / GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and **Windsurf**.
- **Gemini CLI Optimization**: Added support for hierarchical scopes (User/Project), automated trust workflows (`gemini trust`), and safety-first CLI syntax using the `--` argument separator.
- **Antigravity Interoperability**: Documented the managed configuration ecosystem for Antigravity and added a comparison guide for users running both IDE and CLI tools.
- **VS Code Native Support**: Fully documented the `mcp.json` native integration for GitHub Copilot, including workspace-level configurations (`.vscode/mcp.json`) for team sharing.
- **Branding**: Updated visual identity with high-fidelity "Works with" badges for Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and Codex CLI.

### Fixed
- **Naming Consistency**: Standardized server identifiers to `k8s-helm-mcp` (CLI) and `k8sHelm` (VS Code) across all supported environments to ensure persistent connectivity.
- **Configuration Duplication**: Consolidated overlapping integration options and re-ordered the guide into a logical, sequential 10-option workflow.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Multi-Client Integration**: Added native support and documentation for **Codex** (OpenAI), **Windsurf** (Codeium), **Antigravity** (Google DeepMind), **Cursor**, and **GitHub Copilot (VS Code)**.

    - Integrated a **high-resolution 7-spoked hybrid logo** into the server's visual identity, now visible in IDE connector UIs (Claude Desktop, etc.) via `iconUrl` metadata.
- **Cloud Provider Error Handling**: Integrated smart detection for **EKS (AWS)**, **GKE (Google)**, and **AKS (Azure)** authentication failures, providing actionable login commands and CLI installation links directly in tool error responses.
- **Proactive CLI Checks**: Added detection for missing cloud CLIs (`aws`, `gcloud`, `az`) when used as authentication plugins, with platform-specific recovery guidance.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-05
